        <h2>Curry Goat</h2>

    <div class="normalText">
        <p>Jamaican Curry Goat – insanely delicious slow-cooked Jamaican Spiced Curry that is full of flavor and tender to the bone! An absolutely must-make Jamaican food! So easy to make with minimal prep.</p>
        <p>If you ask anyone who loves Jamaican food to pick his or her favorite, this Curry Goat would no doubt make an appearance on the list. It isn’t celebrated nearly enough as it should. Most people shy away from it. Not a good thing. In fact, did you know it is the most consumed meat throughout the universe? Its health benefits are staggering when compared to other kinds of beef, including chicken. It has less saturated fat, calories, and cholesterol.</p>
        <p>Goat meat is comparable to beef shanks or briskets. So feel free to swap the goat meat for these cuts of meat. This Jamaican Curry Goat is one of my favorite Jamaican dishes — never seem to get enough off of it. Chunky pieces of goat are slowly simmered in aromatic blend garlic, ginger, thyme, onions, and hot pepper and with curry taking center stage, until thick and creamy or however, you like it. </p>
